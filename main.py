"""
Skhell Machine — cellular automaton sandbox.

Architecture (incremental cleanup from a pre-OOP codebase):
  cells.py       – Cell data object
  buttons.py     – UI button widget + easing
  anim.py        – simple lerp helper
  registry.py    – cell type descriptions, tags, categories (extracted)
  game_state.py  – GameState owning grid/cells/effects (extracted; migrate call sites over time)
  main.py        – simulation, rendering, input, main loop

Simulation state is still mostly module-level globals for compatibility; new code
should prefer GameState methods (register_cell, add_cell, move_cell_to, …).
